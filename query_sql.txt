1-HackerRank(Top Earners)
Finding the maximum product of months and salary among employees and counting how many employees have this maximum product
Query-
SELECT 
    MAX(months * salary),
    COUNT(*)
FROM 
    Employee
WHERE 
    months * salary = (
        SELECT MAX(months * salary) FROM Employee
    );
2-Average Population of all cities rounded to nearest Integer-
SELECT FLOOR(AVG(POPULATION))
FROM CITY;

Note-To round off to specific digit we can use Round function as ROUND(value,n) n is the number of difit to be rounded.

3-Sum and Round to 2-
Query-
select ROUND(SUM( LAT_N),2), ROUND(SUM(LONG_W),2) FROM  STATION ;
4-Query LAN_W WHERE LAN_L is max and less that 137.2245 upto 4 decimal places.
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4)  FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N=(SELECT MAX(LAT_N ) FROM  STATION WHERE LAT_N <137.2345);

5-Consider  and  P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where 
a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.

Query-
SELECT ROUND(ABS(c.LAT_N - a.LAT_N) + ABS(d.LONG_W - b.LONG_W), 4) AS Manhattan_Distance
FROM
    (SELECT LAT_N FROM STATION ORDER BY LAT_N ASC LIMIT 1) AS a,  -- Point A: Min LAT_N
    (SELECT LONG_W FROM STATION ORDER BY LONG_W ASC LIMIT 1) AS b, -- Point B: Min LONG_W
    (SELECT LAT_N FROM STATION ORDER BY LAT_N DESC LIMIT 1) AS c,  -- Point C: Max LAT_N
    (SELECT LONG_W FROM STATION ORDER BY LONG_W DESC LIMIT 1) AS d; -- Point D: Max LONG_W

Query the Euclidean distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.
Query-
SELECT ROUND(SQRT(POW(c.LAT_N - a.LAT_N, 2) + POW(d.LONG_W - b.LONG_W, 2)), 4) AS Euclidean_Distance
FROM
    (SELECT LAT_N FROM STATION ORDER BY LAT_N ASC LIMIT 1) AS a,  -- Point A: Min LAT_N
